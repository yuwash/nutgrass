# nutgrass

Simple NGSI utility

Currently Python3 is not supported, because this depends on
[iotqatools](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotqatools) that doesn't.

# Installation
As iotqatools is not available from PyPI, you need to do this:

```
# before: git clone this repository and cd to the directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
